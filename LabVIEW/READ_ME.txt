This folder contains examples of the two big projects I have personally developed using LabVIEW. 
For proprietary and academic reasons I cannot disclose the back panel code. However, I have provided
examples of the front panels I have created to showcase the quality of my work for front end applications. 
The latest code is shown in the ms_reserach_front_panel_example_#.pngs. The code I developed for a Total 
Internal Reflection microscpe is shown in the other images.
