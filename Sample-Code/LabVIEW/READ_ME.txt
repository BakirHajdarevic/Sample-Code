This folder contains examples of the two big LabVIEW projects that I have worked on. 
For proprietary and academic reasons I cannot disclose files of the orignal code. 
However, I have provided examples of the front panels I have created to showcase the 
quality of my work for front end applications. 

Examples of my latest work from graduate school is shown in the ms_reserach-_.pngs. 
Two of these images showcase how I create and organize subvi's within a larger VI.

The code I developed for a Total Internal Reflection microscpe is shown in the other images.
